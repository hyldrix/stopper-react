# Project - React Stopper - Static 

This project has been completed as a part of JavaScript Front-end Bootcamp @ Kodilla.
Project utilises clean JavaScript and React. During the project I have learned how to work useState and useEffect hooks. The aim of this project was to broaden understanding of component lifecycle.
